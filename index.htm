          Hailing from Miami FL the trio is known for having very flamboyant style 
          and yet exceptional taste in women. They called Miami home for quite some 
          time, yes, but have sadly gone their separate ways. A full reunion is yet 
          to be seen, although they vow to some day purchase a small island in the 
          middle of no where to hold radical parties of epic proportion.</p>

              Wanton Eats the Breakfast of Billionaires (Diamond infused Wheaties), 
            and poops himself every time he makes another billion dollars (or even 
            thinks about his billions of dollars for that matter.&nbsp; Balancing his 
            chequebook is extremely difficult.&nbsp; He needs more billionaire product at 
            that time of the month.)&nbsp; He also has a hard time saying the word 
            billion without stuttering on the &quot;B&quot; and nearly, if not actually, 
            puking upon saying the word.</address>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He once had a dream about how to 
          construct the perfect sandwich and has been very passionate about creating 
          this perfect sandwich since.&nbsp; The tragedy is that he had this dream after 
          he made his billions of dollars, and everyone knows a billionaire cannot 
          make their own food.&nbsp; So instead he created numerous sandwich empires such 
          as Blimpie, Subway, Quiznos and more, but the perfect sandwich was hard to 
          create without him actually making one as a model.<br>
          <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rumored that a 
          perfect sandwich was actually made by one of his franchises in 1994 and 
          given to an old lady somewhere in McCracken County near Freemont Kentucky 
          but it was traaaaaaaaaagically mishandled and dropped, sending it 
          plummeting into the depths of the perfect sandwich abyss.</i></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wanton also enjoys crazy pants, 
          melodramatic Russians, peanut butter and mayonnaise cookies (ask him 
          how!), seasonal candles, Roald Dahl, completely dry socks, licking gummy 
          bears and then throwing them at surfaces, satisfying farts, people with 
          flat tires, tired old people, overstuffed chairs (and Oreos), underwater 
          basket weaving, filling keyholes with $100 bills, clothing made of money, 
          and pillow slips. He has an irrational fear of tiny puddles and Santa 
          Clause (how can someone whip reindeer one second and love children the 
          next?).</i></p>

              Duke LaCrosse who sells babies on the black market, also enjoys riding 
            on swings.&nbsp; He has swing sets made of pure pearl, diamond, and 
            platinum.&nbsp; Duke LaCrosse made his first few millions by investing 
            in stock for the Gideon bible (the one that annoys you every time you 
            look for leftover porn in hotel rooms).&nbsp; His next venture capital 
            involved the pre-recording that stifles you every time you try to leave 
            a message with a douche who doesn't have an actual message recorded (&quot;To 
            leave a message, press 1 or simply wait for the tone.&nbsp; To leave a 
            callback number...press 5 now&quot;).&nbsp; He also invented tampons. And 
            created the false rumor that TSS exists in order to keep his own deluded 
            self worth (and sales) up.  </address>

              Czar Budinski was born with a name fit for a Tsar. Of course coming from 
            a family deeply rooted in the old school, the spelling his parents chose 
            is of the old Latin root, which more closely resembles the spelling of 
            Cesar.  </address>

          <address align="left">The Tsar Czar Budinski is a notorious womanizer and 
            gambler. He has faked his own death in several countries and evaded 
            legal charges and angry husbands, only to resurface living in other 
            other gambling meccas. He has been know to be accompanied by a harem of 
            high end call girls and is widely recognized by authorities in Vegas, 
            Bangkok, and Dubai as the &quot;Cellophane King&quot;. Other aliases include Lord 
            Budinski, The Slongoyan Power Deuce, and the Modest Mofioso. Csar is 
            often also accompanied by his loyal strong arm Orsen who doubles as his 
            driver in sticky situations.  </address>

                when tourist and patrons of Bangkok's red light district watched in 
                amazement as Csar streaked neighboring Danang Street wearing only 
                his diamond studded slippers. Authorities pursued on foot but were 
                unable to detain the Tsar.&quot; </td>

            whores, cuz the Csar's here to close the doors!&quot;</address>
